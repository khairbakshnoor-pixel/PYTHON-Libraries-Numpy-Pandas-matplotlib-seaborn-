📊 Data Analysis & Visualization with Python
NumPy • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn

🚀 This repository contains my hands-on practice, concepts, and projects using Python’s most powerful data analysis and visualization libraries.
All code files in this repo are written by me while learning and practicing real-world data handling and plotting techniques.

🧠 Libraries Covered
🔢 NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy is used for numerical computations and array operations.

✔ What I practiced:

Creating 1D & 2D arrays

Array indexing & slicing

Mathematical operations on arrays

Statistical functions (mean, sum, min, max)

Shape, reshape & dimensions

Random number generation

📌 Why NumPy?
It provides fast performance and is the foundation of data science libraries.

🐼 Pandas (Data Analysis)

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames and Series.

✔ What I practiced:

Creating DataFrames & Series

Reading data from files

Handling missing values (NaN)

Filtering, sorting & indexing data

GroupBy operations

Data cleaning & transformation

Column and row operations

📌 Why Pandas?
It makes working with structured data easy and efficient.

📈 Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

Matplotlib is used for basic and advanced plotting.

✔ What I practiced:

Line plots

Bar charts

Histograms

Scatter plots

Pie charts

Labels, titles & legends

Customizing graphs

📌 Why Matplotlib?
It gives full control over visualizations.

🎨 Seaborn (Advanced Visualization)

Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and is used for beautiful and statistical plots.

✔ What I practiced:

Count plots

Box plots

Heatmaps

Pair plots

Distribution plots

Styling and themes

Visualizing relationships between variables

📌 Why Seaborn?
It creates clean, attractive, and informative charts with less code.
